Algorithm 1: Method to find the highest mark and lowest mark

Function findMaxMark(studentMarks):
    Assign maxMark to the first element of studentMarks array
    
Loop:   For each mark in the studentMarks array:
        If mark > maxMark:
            Set maxMark to mark
            
    Return maxMark

Function findMinMark(studentMarks):
    Assign minMark to the first element of studentMarks array
    
Loop:   For each mark in the studentMarks array:
        If mark < minMark:
            Set minMark to mark
            
    Return minMark


Algorithm 2: Method to find the mean and standard deviation

Function calculateMeanMark(studentMarks):
    Assign 0 to sum
    
    For each mark in studentMarks:
        Add mark to sum
        
    Return sum divided by the length of studentMarks

Function calculateStandardDeviationMark(studentMarks):
    Assign 0 to sum 
    Assign 0 to standardDeviation
    
    For each mark in studentMarks:
        Add mark to sum
        Add (mark - (sum / length of studentMarks))^2 to standardDeviation
        
    Return the square root of (standardDeviation divided by the length of studentMarks)
